## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── content/
│   │   └── docs/
│   ├── styles/
│   │   └── global.css
│   └── content.config.ts
├── astro.config.mjs
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

The project includes [Tailwind CSS](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/css-and-tailwind/#tailwind-css) for styling. Customize your design by modifying `src/styles/global.css`.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
